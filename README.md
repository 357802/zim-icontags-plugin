### What is this plugin for

This plugin provides a new Index like panel with icons, tagnames and some other features.    
A new Tagsmanager dialog is added to simplify some basic operations with tags and allow to set icons for pages based on tags. 
More information can be found in [IconTags.txt](IconTags.txt).

### How to install

The plugin can be installed like any other plugin for Zim by copying [IconTags.py](IconTags.py) file to the folder with plugins (for more information look at https://github.com/jaap-karssenberg/zim-wiki/wiki/Plugins). 

To install icons the [Tags_Icons](Tags_Icons) directory with all files in it should be copied to the zim's 'pixmaps' folder.    
In Windows this folder can be found in Zim's directory (e.g. "C:/Zim Desktop Wiki/data" for version with installer and "C:/Zim Portable/App/ZimDesktopWiki/data" for a portable version); in Linux Mint in "/usr/share/zim/pixmaps".
