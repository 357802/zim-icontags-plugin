====== IconTags Plugin ======

This plugin provides a new Index like panel with icons, tagnames and some other features.
A new Tagsmanager dialog is added to simplify some basic operations with tags and allow to set icons for pages based on tags. 
Some other minor options are added.

**Dependencies:** This plugin has no additional dependencies.

===== Plugin options =====
The option **Enable icon shortcodes** allows to enable icons based on shortcodes in the text.
The option **Show lines in tree** shows vertical lines in the icIndex panel to visually separate pages and their subpages.

===== Icons =====
Every page can have its own icon. By default there are only icons to indicate whether a page has subpages or tags. 
To assign another icon for a page a shortcode should be inserted in the text. This can be done by typing it or selecting in the top menu **Insert-> Insert icon**. 
If **Enable icon shortcodes** option is enabled in plugin options the selected icon will be shown in the icIndex panel next to the pagename. 
It is also possible to assign icons based on a tag present on the page (see TagsManager section below) 

===== TagsManager =====
Tagsmanager is a dialog with the list of all tags sorted by different parameners. 
To show it press **Alt-2** or choose **Tools-> Tags manager** option in the top menu. 
You can anytime close the dialog and return back to text by pressing **Esc** button.

Tags manager contains several columns â€“ name of a tag, number of pages containing the tag and an icon assigned to the tag. There are three buttons: 
**OK** to save changes, 
**Cancel** to discard changes, 
**Show Pages** to see pages corresponding to the selected tag, left/right keys can toggle this button.

=== Set icon to tag ===
If left mouse button is pressed on the icon's column of a tag a popup menu with available icons will appear. A selected icon will be assigned to all pages containing the corresponding tag and will be shown in the icIndex next to the pagename. Don't forget to save changes by pressing **OK** button.

=== Put tag into text ===
If mouse is double clicked on a tagname it will be inserted into the text at the cursor position. 

=== An example of using TagsManager to put tags into text ===
Set cursor to the place in the text where you want to see a tag, press **Alt-2** to show TagsManager dialog, choose an appropriate tag with mouse or start typing the name of the tag until the tag will be selected, after that press **Enter** or double click to input tag into the text. Close tagsmanager by pressing **Esc** button.

===== icIndex popup menu =====
If right mouse button is pressed in the icIndex panel the popup menu will appear. It contains a new **View** with several options.
Choose **Show only pages with tags** to show in the tree only pages containing tags or/and subpages,
**Show tags** to show all tags right after the pagename in the tree.

Other options adjust icIndex behaviour on open new pages.
Choose **Default** to automatically open in the tree subpages of the current page (this is the default behaviour in the Index panel),
**Collapse other pages** to automatically close all previously opened subpages,
**Disable** to prevent automatically opening/closing new subpages.

===== Restrictions =====
Only one icon can be set for a page at a time. 
Icons set by shortcodes have higher priority over icons set by tags. 
If there is more than one icon with the same priority level for this page an error icon will be set.
